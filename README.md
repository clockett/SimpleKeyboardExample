# SimpleKeyboardExample

This project is a simple example of how to handle moving a text field into view when the keyboard is displayed
and scrolling it back into the original position when the keyboard is hidden.

It also includes using a tap gesture to dismiss the keyboard, using a responder chain to go from one text field
to the next, and some Unit  and UI test examples.

NOTE: if the UI tests fail, check that the Simulator's "Hardware -> Keyboard -> Toggle Software Keyboard" is selected.
